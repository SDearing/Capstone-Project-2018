# Capstone-Project-2018 Management Document

## Project Idea
My project will be a creation of a 2d side-scrolling beat em' up. This game will include multiplayer options for users and a database holding the users scores of a play session. The game will be based off the arcade game double dragon.


## Aims and Objectives
* Create a 2d beat em up game
* Create Assets for game
* Develop multiplayer options
* Implement a database to hold the users scores
* Develop multiple moves for player character to keep the game interesting
* Design and implement multiple enemy types to add variety to the game
* Design at least 3 different levels
## Deadlines
* Monday 19th Febuary Project Management Document needs to be complete
* Friday 23rd Febuary project design document needs to be complete
* Friday 23rd March Project demo presentation
* Wednesday 28th March Overall project is due

## Overall Management Strategy
* 5th-19th: I will finish this management document, aswell as begin research of game development
* 19th-23rd: I will finish the design document 
* 23rd Feb- 23rd March: Main bulk of the development of the game, by the 23rd of march I will have a presentable demo
* 23rd- 28th March: Final development on game and I will complete the project evaluation

## Requirements
The game engine I will use to develop this game is Unity. I will also need assets to be used in the game, I will create some assets aswell as getting some from the internet. To create and edit assets I will use Adobe Photoshop software.I will also need access to the internet so I can research how to design a 2d side scrolling beat em up, and how to use parts of Unity I am not familiar with.

## Research of how to reduce vunerabilities in software during development
### Introduction
In this report I will investigate possible vunerabilities that in software during development, how these vunerabilities affect businesses and how these vunerabilities can be reduced. Software development is the process of creating software to fufil certain criteria, in a basic sense software is developed by first creating a design, then creating a development plan then developing the software and finally testing and further maintenance on the software even when released to the public, however the order of development and how software is developed is determined by the software lifecycle chosen by the development team. To investigate this report I will investigate secondary data in the form of case studies, in these case studies I will analyse the different software life cycles used, the vunerabilities they were affected by and how they mitigated the vunerabilities.
